# ===========================  Coin Flips ==============================
# Imagine that you are flipping a fair coin, up to 1000 times. 
# Print out the proporation of head after every flip.


# Analysis: 
# We could keep generating a logical variable, using 1 for heads and 0 for tails.
# We also need a vector, which has 1000 elements, recording how many heads we got after each iteration.
# Another vector can be used for recording 1000 probabilities.
# Functions will be used: \textit{sample(), plot()}.


# plot()
plot(x = , y = , )
plot(x = 1:10, y = 1:10)
x <- seq(-2, 2, by = 0.0001)
plot(sin(x), type = "l")


# sample()
?sample
sample(x = , size = , replace = , prob = )
# sample with replacement and sample without replacement

sample(c(0,1), 1)

sample(x = c(1, 0), size = 1, replace = T, prob = c(0.5, 0.5))

# you can also use other functions, such as runif() + round()


No.heads <- 0
result.Vec <- NULL
for (flips in 1:1000)
{
  # x = c(1, 0), 1 means head, 0 means tail
  tmp <- sample(x=c(1, 0), size=1, replace=T, prob=c(0.5, 0.5))   
  # add tmp to number of head, if tmp = 1..., if tmp = 0, ...
  No.heads <- No.heads + tmp      
  result.Vec <- c(result.Vec,No.heads/flips)
}
plot(1:1000, result.Vec, type="l")     # produce a figure



# other parameters in plot()

plot(1:1000, result.Vec, type="l", main="Coin Flips")
plot(1:1000, result.Vec, type="l", main="Coin Flips", ylim = c(0, 1))

# ===========================In class exercise==================================
# Assume there is a black box which has throw out a random number each time (1, 2, 3), 
# The probablity to obtain each sample is 0.2, 0.5, 0.3 respectively.
# Theoritically, what is the average value you can have from the black box?
# How to verify this value using sample() function?


# ======================= Generating Random Variables =========================

?rnorm
# rnorm(n = , mean = , sd = )

# ==============================Binomial distribution==============================

###### what is the qbinom() and how it works?


#=============================Negative Binomial=========================================

#Negative binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution of the number of successes 
#in a sequence of independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials 
#before a specified (non-random) number of failure (denoted r) occurs

#Assuming we are tossing a fair coin, what's the probability to observe the 2nd head at the 5th trial?

dnbinom(x = 3, size = 2, prob = 0.5) #x denotes the number of failure, size denotes the number of success


#What is the probability to have at most 3 failure?
